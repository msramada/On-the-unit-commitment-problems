# On the unit commitment problem
This notebook contains the dynamic programming solution to a 2-unit commitment problem.

The notation, state transition dynamics and cost, follow that in:

``Lauer, G.S., Sandell, N.R., Bertsekas, D.P. and Posbergh, T.A., 1982. Solution of large-scale optimal unit commitment problems. IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems, (1), pp.79-86.''

We use the Julia programming language. The required packages are Plots and LaTeXStrings, both are unnecessary except for demo purposes.
